# Wrangling the CSS Beast with Sass

Example code to accompany my presentation on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) at
the 2011 [VT Code Camp](http://vtcodecamp.org/).

**Abstract**

> Sass is an extension of CSS3 that adds power and elegance to the basic
> language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline
> imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. (With a little help
> from Ruby) This talk will cover an overview of what Sass is, how to get it,
> run it, and use it, and show some examples of its magic.
